      How to Use This Tool 
      <a href="http://ghukek.com/ght.html" style="font-size: 0.6em; margin-left: 0.5em;">(More info and contact)</a>
    </h2>
    <h3>Selecting passages by reference:</h3>
    <p>Select your start and end book, chapter, and verse from "Start Ref" and "End Ref". </p>
    <p>You may manually adjust how many verses to show at a time to by changing 'Verse Range'. A 'Verse Range' of '1' will show one verse. </p>
    <p>You may select as many verses as you want by unchecking 'Fixed', but be warned that it may take a while to load very large selections. If you have 'Fixed' unchecked, then when going forwards from your current selection, I recommend changing the 'Start Ref' first. If you go past the current 'End Ref', the tool will automatically snap the 'End Ref' to be a few verses past your new 'Start Ref' by default. Likewise if you are going backwards, change the 'End Ref' first.</p>
    <p>The 'Load' button will load the current reference selection. This is only necessary when the user has searched and wants to go back to the current selection.</p>
    <p>The 'Interlinear Options' are a list of parameters that can be shown on screen. Any parameters left unchecked will be shown in a popup window for each word. The options are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Greek: shows the Greek text.</li>
      <li>English: shows the English translation.</li>
      <li>Morphology: shows grammatical information in abbreviated form. Expanded grammar information is shown in the popup.</li>
      <li>Strong's: shows Strong’s Concordance numbers.</li>
      <li>Roots: shows my personal categorization of related words by showing the primitive roots from which they are constructed. Greek has many compound words. This is meant to be a more comprehesive set of connections than the Strong's concordance numbers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The 'Display Options' allow you to adjust how to show the selected passages. You can also save or reset your settings here.</p>
    <h3>Searching:</h3>
    <p>To search, type text into the search bar and click 'Search'. You may also click on any clickable string in the body of the text or in the popups to automatically search that string. Use the 'Greek Keyboard' if you do not have a Greek keyboard set up in your operating system and want to type in Greek. When 'Greek Keyboard' is checked, the search bar will automatically convert your input to Greek characters to allow you to search for Greek words. Click the '?' button to see an image of a Greek keyboard if you don't know how to type in Greek. You may search for multiple words at a time.</p>
    <p>The 'Search Options' allow you to customize your search parameters. The explanation for these are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Exact Match: When checked, the search will only show words that are exactly as what you typed in (case insensitive). Otherwise, it will return all partial matches. When searching in English, "exact match" will take out any punctuation and add implied "of{" or "to{" brackets, such that if you were to search for "of{jesus}", you would find all cases of ιησου translated to the genitive case.</li>
      <li>Center Ref: When checked, this will center the verse containing the search terms in its context. Otherwise, the verse containing the search terms will be shown as the start of its context. For example, with a context of 5 verses, "the jesus tears." will show John 11:35-39 when unchecked or John 11:33-37 when checked.</li>
      <li>Show Context: When checked, this will return search results in the verse they appear in plus as much surrounding context as the user selects using 'Verse Range'. Otherwise it will just return a list of search results and the verse reference they appear in.</li>
      <li>Normalize English: When checked, this will ignore punctuation and pull text out of nested brackets. For example, a search for "of{Jesus}" will not show cases of "of{the Jesus}" unless this is checked. </li>
      <li>Unique Words: When checked, this will only show uniqe word pairs rather than every result. This is useful if a user is trying to look at all the different ways a specific word may be translated or inflected.</li>
      <li>Ordered: When searching for multiple words, this forces the words to appear in the order they were searched. So, "Jesus Anointed" will not return verses that have "Anointed Jesus" (e.g. Acts 5:42). Note that this setting will work for whichever word order you have currently checked. Thus, "ου μη" (Exact Match, Ordered, Adjacent) will return a lot of results in interlinear order, but zero in reverse interlinear.</li>
      <li>Adjacent: When searching for multiple words, this forces the words to be adjacent to each other. So, "Jesus Anointed" will not return "Jesus, the being-said 'Anointed'" (e.g. Matthew 1:18). </li>
    </ul>
    <p>For multiple word searches, with everything unchecked, the search will check the entire selected context for the words, no matter how far apart, out of order, or partial matching they may be. To restrict your search, you would want to reduce the 'Verse Range', check 'Exact Match', 'Ordered', or 'Adjacent' and any combination of these.</p>
    <h3>Sharing:</h3>
    <p>The tool can save the current reference selection to the URL so that the user can share a passage via link. Or, the user can share a particular search result. See the 'Save as URL:' buttons.</p>
    <h3>Back and Forward:</h3>
    <p>These buttons bring you to your last render state. It stores up to 100 renders in history.</p>
    <h3>Copy text:</h3>
    <p>For now, these only work for text showing on screen. They will copy all Greek or English text to your clipboard when you are verse-display mode.</p>

      Important Translator Notes 
    </h2>
    <p>The following is small selectiong from Garth's introduction. For more information, click on "GHT Source" and click on "Introduction (Please read!)..."</p>
    <h3><span class="hi">Notation</span>, punctuation, capitalization</h3>
    <p>Every word, or construction between spaces, including possible hyphens and slash characters, or as demarcated within underscore characters, maps to one, single, corresponding word in the original Greek text, unless it is in square brackets.  I separately translate every single word in the Greek, something that no other translation does. I use</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="hi">square brackets</span> to denote something I have added for clarity that is not in the original text.</li>
      <li>An <span class="hi">[ing]</span> on a participle means it is an aorist or future participle, not a present participle.</li>
      <li>As noted in more detail below, I use 
        <ul>
          <li><span class="hi">curly brackets</span> to denote dative and genitive cases and </li>
          <li>a <span class="hi">colon</span> to denote third-person imperatives.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>I liberally use
        <ul>
          <li><span class="hi">hyphens</span> to bring out etymological/morphemes, compound words, and single words from the original that do not have a single English correspondence but can be expressed using multiple English words and/or English morphemes, and</li>
          <li><span class="hi">underscore</span> to insert separate original words into a hyphenated sequence (usually "_not_").</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>I use the <span class="hi">slash character</span> where I need to convey that a word could be either one or the other English word, or a sense of both or something in between.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Since interrogatives are not punctuated in the Greek, and are not even explicit, I let the text flow as in the original and insert question mark characters in square brackets.  Beyond that, punctuation is simply a best-effort attempt to follow English convention.  There is little to no punctuation in the original Greek text, and not in the English sense or English convention.  I capitalize proper names as in English, but there is no capitalization scheme in Greek.  Verse number placement adheres to the convention originated by the Geneva Bible.</p>
    <h3>Important points in lexicality and grammar, issues</h3>
    <p>I use "of{}" and "to{}" for genitive and dative cases, respectively, but everyone should keep in mind that these are not prepositions, nor do they, without actual prepositions, create prepositional phrases in the original Greek.  The genitive case simply points from an object and the dative case to an object.  However, when I create an English prepositional phrase from it, I don't always keep prefixing every consecutive genitive or dative word accordingly.  Instead, I enclose multiple separate words in curly brackets, which are all genitive or dative, as the case may be.</p>
    <p>The Greek language has both second and third person imperative verbs, whereas English only has second person imperatives.  To translate the third person, I construct the phrase using a colon.  For example, Matt 5:16, "the light of you: shine," such that it is the light that is being given the imperative, the command, not the person being addressed.  This eliminates the traditional use of "let" (e.g. "let your light shine"), where "let" is a verb that only means "allow," still in the second person, and does not bring out the imperative sense of the actual verb (i.e. "allow your light to shine" has "allow" as an imperative in the second person and "shine" as an infinitive). </p>
